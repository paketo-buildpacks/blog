The [Build Plan buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-community/build-plan)
gives you very precise control over what buildpacks run during a build and what
dependencies end up in the final image. Let's talk about how it works and
why/when you would utilize this kind of functionality.

### What is the Build Plan?

The Build Plan is a part of the Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) specification
that is the format for how buildpacks communicate during the [detect phase](https://paketo.io/docs/buildpacks/#detect-phase) of
the lifecycle. Buildpacks write out a Build Plan that outlines the
dependency that the buildpack will either provide or require during its build
phase. Buildpacks may both require and provide any number of dependencies. For
detection to pass a buildpacks must have all of the dependencies it requires,
provided by a buildpack that comes before it in the build order and it needs to
have all of the dependencies that it provides, required by buildpacks that come
later in the build order. If either of these conditions is not satisfied
detection will fail for that buildpack. A more in-depth breakdown of the Build
Plan can be found in the [CNB
Spec](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md).

### How does the Build Plan Buildpack work?

The Build Plan Buildpack works by adding a `plan.toml`, which mirrors the
[requires portion of Build
Plan](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#build-plan-toml),
to the root of your app. The buildpack will read the `plan.toml` and make all
of the requirements listed in it for you. This means that if you add a
`plan.toml` to the root of your app and then add the Build Plan buildpack to
the end of your  buildpack group, you will be able to make any arbitrary
requirements that you want. Furthermore, if you are using the Build Plan
Buildpack with Paketo Buildpacks it will allow you to specify when you want the
dependency to be present whether that is during build-time, at launch-time, or both. You
can specify this for Paketo Buildpacks because they respect two flags that go
in the `metadata` field of a requirement. Those two flags are `build` and
`launch`, `build` makes the dependency available during the build phase of
subsequent buildpacks in the order, and `launch` makes the dependency available
in the final running image.

### Why would I want this?

The Build Plan Buildpack is incredibly useful in writing
integration tests for dependency buildpacks (buildpacks that contain a dependency). Let's use a [Go Dist
buildpack integration
app](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-dist/tree/main/integration/testdata/default_app)
as an example. The `plan.toml` for that app looks as follow:
```
[[requires]]
  name = "go"

  [requires.metadata]
    launch = true
```
The Build Plan Buildpack is used here so that we don't need to use either the
[Go Mod Vendor](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-mod-vendor) or the [Go Build](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-build) buildpacks to require the `go` dependency. We can
also force the `go` dependency, which in this case is the Go compiler, to be
present in the final running image, which it normally is absent from. This
allows us to run various `go` commands to ensure that it is installed properly
without relying on any other buildpacks in the Go language family.

There are other applications where the use of the Build Plan buildpack would
enable a build that would be hard if not impossible to detect automatically, or
to make an image as small as possible. 

An example of this would be an app that has a simple Nodejs frontend and has a Go backend.
You could add the Node Engine and Build Plan buildpack to the order grouping of
your build and write a `plan.toml` that required the node engine during launch.
This would force the Node Engine buildpack's detection to pass and the build
phase would install the node engine into the image and make it available during
build.

There are countless scenarios that you could propose that are
made possible by using the Build Plan buildpack, so we encourage everyone to
check it out, play with it, and see what you can do with it. If you have any
questions you can always feel free to ask us using any of the platforms listed
below and we would be more than happy to try and help you.

Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last
year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our
[2021 Roadmap](https://blog.paketo.io/posts/2021-roadmap/). We won’t be able to
cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.

### Solidifying Existing Buildpacks

While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the
progres we have made, including:

* Moving to [environment
  variables](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0026-environment-variable-configuration-of-buildpacks.md)
  as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks
* Standardized handling of [language-ecosystem environment
  variables](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0019-buildpack-set-env-vars-defaults.md)
  such as `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` and `NODE_ENV`
* [Standardized
  versioning](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0029-semantic-versioning.md)
  of buildpacks, stacks, and builders
* Standardized configuration options, including [log
  levels](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0027-log-levels.md)
  and [dependency
  mappings](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0010-dependency-mappings.md)
* Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to:
  * [Configure additional CA
    Certificates](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/configuration/#ca-certificates)
  * [Apply custom image
    labels](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/configuration/#applying-custom-labels)
  * [Set runtime environment
    variables](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/environment-variables)
  * [Contribute additional process
    types](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/configuration/#procfiles)

We also [restructured the Python
buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/python/0001-restructure.md),
improving modularity and composability. A similar [restructure of the PHP
buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/php/0001-restructure.md)
is nearing completion.

### Expanding the Buildpack Ecosystem

We have expanded our buildpack offering to support additional types of applications:

* [Production-grade support for
  Python](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0035-python-promotion.md)
  applications
* [Introductory support for Rust](https://github.com/paketo-community/rust)
  applications
* [Introductory support for Javascript
  frontend](https://github.com/paketo-community/web-servers) applications
* Support for additional Java application servers including [Apache
  Tomee](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0011-apache-tomee.md),
  [Open
  Liberty](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0008-add-liberty-to-java-composite.md),
  and [Websphere
  Liberty](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0008-add-liberty-to-java-composite.md)
* Support for additional JVM implementations including [Microsoft
  OpenJDK](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0001-microsoft-jdk.md),
  [Alibaba
  Dragonwell](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0002-alibaba-jdk.md),
  and
  [Oracle](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0006-oracle-jdk.md)
* Support for [building Clojure
  applications](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0005-clojure-tools.md)
  with Clojure Tools
* [Datadog
  support](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/java/0009-datadog.md)
  for Java applications

A big thank you to our community of users who have provided feedback about your
use cases and an especially big thank you to those of you who have helped
expand our feature-set with contributions. Keep that feedback coming!

### Non-production Use Cases

In order to better support development use cases, we introduced an interface
for enabling [reloadable process
types](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0032-reloadable-process-types.md),
which can be used in combination with a dev orchestration tool like [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) or
[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/dev/) to rapidly iterate in a production-like environment.

We defined a common interface for enabling [remote
debugging](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0037-remote-debug.md).
This interface is supported by the Java buildpack. Expect to see it rolled out
more broadly in 2022.

### Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM)

Curious about what’s in your image? Although this wasn’t originally a 2021
roadmap theme, we are happy to share the progress we have made generating SBOMs
in a standardized format.

Since the Cloud Native Buildpacks project added support for [structured
SBOMs](https://github.com/buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0095-sbom.md), we have
rolled out Syft JSON-formatted SBOMs in the Java, Nodejs, and Go buildpacks,
and more are on the way. This data can be used to improve the accuracy of
security scans and to automate other compliance tasks.

### Congratulations on a fantastic 2021!

As great a year as we had in 2021, we’re not stopping there. We’ve got big
plans for 2022, which are already underway. Checkout our next blog post on the
2022 Roadmap for details.

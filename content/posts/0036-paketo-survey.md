## User Survey 2025

As long as I have been working on Paketo Buildpacks, it has been a challenge to understand how our users make use of the project. What buildpacks get used? What features are important? Where should we spend project time and resources? We just don't know :man_shrugging:

This is because for your privacy, Paketo Buildpacks do not have telemetry in them nor do they capture any information about your usage patterns. Because we do not capture telemetry, it does make it difficult for the project to plan and prioritize work for our buildpacks.

**To help the project, we are launching the Paketo Buildpacks End of 2025 Users Survey!**

This is a survey that we're inviting our users to take so we can capture voluntary feedback on usage of buildpacks.

Your feedback in this survey is critical as it will allow us to understand what is important to our users and the results will help us shape the future of Paketo Buildpacks in ways most helpful to our users.

The survey is completely voluntary, so no fields are required. We are just asking users to provide as much information as they are comfortable to share as a way to help the project.

If you would like to take the survey, here's the link: [Paketo Buildpacks 2025 Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw967tlCIx5TwYcsKqau1vL6gROOcpFdskkJdxcowT7Na4Zg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=100089145604715528079)

The survey will run through Jan 16th 2026 to give users plenty of time to get in their input.

Thanks in advance to everyone for their feedback & participation!

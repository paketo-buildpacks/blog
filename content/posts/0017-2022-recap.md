In 2022, the major roadmap themes were improvements and expansions of our stack
offerings, paying down significant technical debt in our dependency management
system, and making efforts to improve buildpack authoring tools.

## Improving and Expanding our Base Image / Stack / Builder Offering

We launched sweeping support for Ubuntu 2022.04 Jammy Jellyfish across our
stacks, buildpacks, and builders. This was a tremendous effort with
contributions across the entire Paketo Core team and community. It touched
every buildpack and took the better part of 9 months to complete as we resolved
huge amounts of technical debt in the process. If you are more interested in
what happened on this front, check out the RFCs below:

* [Stacks RFC0003: Stack Descriptor and Tooling](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/stacks/0003-stack-descriptor.md)
* [Stacks RFC0004: Stacks based on Ubuntu 2022.04: Jammy Jellyfish](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/stacks/0004-jammy-jellyfish.md)
* [Stacks RFC0005: Updates to Stacks based on Ubuntu Bionic](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/stacks/0005-bionic-stack-updates.md)
* [RFC0052: Graceful Stack Upgrades](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0052-graceful-stack-upgrades.md)

## Improvements to Dependency Management and Caching

In the process of rolling out Jammy Jellyfish across all of our buildpacks, we
paid down a significant amount of technical debt in our dependency management
infrastructure. We've moved to a system that biases itself to download
dependencies from their canonical upstream location and federated our build
infrastructure across the language-ecosystem teams, putting more control in
these maintainer's hands. For more details about what's been going on with
buildpack dependencies, take a look at the following RFCs:

* [Dependencies RFC0003: Buildpack Dependency Management Improvement Overview](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/dependencies/rfcs/0003-dependency-management-overview.md)
* [RFC0043: Expanding the Criteria for Reproducible Builds](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0043-reproducible-builds.md)
* [RFC0046: Define an Image & Dependency Retention Policy for Paketo Images](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0046-image-retention-policy.md)

## Improving the Buildpack Authoring Experience

At several points last year, we spent some time trying to bring `packit` and
`libcnb` closer together. The goal of this effort has been to simplify the
development and contribution process for users outside of the Paketo core team.
For some of the details, read up on Dan's blog post and some PRs in `libcnb`
below:

* [Buildpack Development: Selecting a Cloud-Native Buildpacks Library](https://blog.paketo.io/posts/buildpack-dev-selecting-a-library/)
* [libcnb#82: Replace Builder and Detector with functions](https://github.com/buildpacks/libcnb/pull/82)
* [libcnb#74: Removes LayerContributor concept](https://github.com/buildpacks/libcnb/pull/74)
* [libcnb#151: Extract method for generating Config](https://github.com/buildpacks/libcnb/pull/151)

## Other Milestones

While we made progress on the big themes in the 2022 Roadmap, we also hit some
major milestones in other parts of the project.

The Web Servers Buildpack was promoted from the "community" organization to
join the rest of the fully-supported buildpacks. It provides a much improved
experience for developers looking to build front-end applications.

* [RFC0047: Web Servers Buildpack Promotion](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0047-promote-web-servers-buildpack.md)
* [Introducing the Paketo Web Servers Buildpack](https://blog.paketo.io/posts/webservers-rearchitecture/)

The PHP Buildpack was rewritten from the ground up to better support ongoing
maintenance and future development. We look forward to making further progress
on supporting the PHP ecosystem in 2023.

* [PHP RFC0001: Restructuring PHP Buildpacks](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/php/0001-restructure.md)
* [Reintroducing the PHP Buildpack](https://blog.paketo.io/posts/php-rearchitecture/)

The project also added support for debugging processes in .NET Core and
generalized application healthchecking. Check out those RFCs for more details:

* [Utilities RFC0007: Health Checker Support](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/utilities/0007-health-checker-buildpack.md)
* [.NET Core RFC0005: Enable Remote Debug Support](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/dotnet-core/0005-debug-support.md)

## The Future

If you are looking to get involved this year, please consider joining the
[Paketo Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/paketobuildpacks/shared_invite/zt-2jayv12ro-eTP8AtcmvyIpEtlANfIb~g) or calling in to one of our weekly
[working group
meetings](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/community#working-group-meetings).
We would love to hear feedback from you!

2022 was a big year for the Paketo Buildpacks project. We've seen a big uptick
in interest, usage, feedback, and contribution. Thank you to our entire
community for helping us make the project better in so many ways. We can't wait
to see where the project goes in 2023. Happy New Year!

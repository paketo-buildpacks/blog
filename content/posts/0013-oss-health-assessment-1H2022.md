In this post, I plan to share the framework the Paketo Buildpacks project will be using to approach the goal of building and sustaining an inclusive community of users, contributors and maintainers; and how it translates to a set of action items we will be executing during the remaining of 2022.


Currently, the project follows the Community Engagement guidelines and best practices [outlined here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-engagement/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md) as they represent a diverse set of initiatives designed to provide the community with tools and processes for improved collaboration. To make sure we are doing it effectively, an assessment is conducted twice per year, providing recommendations and an action plan to address the possible findings.



The following table summarizes the findings for the June 2022 assessment and provides links to corresponding issues. Also it's organized as a timeline for the second half of 2022, which implies the **estimated Level of Effort** to discuss, reach an agreement and implement a solution for each finding:

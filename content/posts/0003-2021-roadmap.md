We‚Äôre not even at the one year anniversary of the Paketo Buildpacks launch, but
we‚Äôve already got so much to celebrate üéâ. 2020 was a busy year for the Paketo
Buildpacks core development team. Looking back on the last year, a few
highlights stand out:

* Establishing our [project
  governance](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
  and [RFC process](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs)
* Moving all project tooling to Github-based workflows
* Building out a foundational set of buildpacks for some of the most popular
  languages including [Java](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/java),
  [Node.js](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs), [.Net
  Core](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/dotnet-core),
  [Go](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go), and
  [Ruby](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ruby).

For 2021, one of our most important goals is to align on a community-driven
project roadmap. We started a discussion
[thread](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/feedback/discussions/2) at the
start of the new year to solicit interest in areas of development for this year
and received a lot of responses.

After synthesizing the community responses, we‚Äôve categorized each into three
main themes:

* **Solidifying Existing Buildpacks**
* **Expanding the Buildpacks Ecosystem**
* **Non-production Use Cases**

These themes cover a broad range of exciting ideas and opportunities, much too
much to cover in a single blog post. And the ideas in each theme aren‚Äôt final.
We‚Äôd love to hear from
[you](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/feedback/discussions/2) about what
languages you are using in your applications and how we can support them with
buildpacks.

## Solidifying Existing Buildpacks

A lot of the work last year involved modularizing monolithic buildpacks into
sets of buildpacks that can be mixed and matched to suit a variety of app
configurations. One of the biggest priorities this year is to continue to
extend and update our existing buildpacks to accommodate changes in upstream
language ecosystems and the [Cloud Native Buildpacks
project](https://buildpacks.io/). We‚Äôll also continue working towards
modularizing our ‚Äúnon-foundational‚Äù buildpacks. This includes work such as
[re-architecting](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/php/pull/267) the [PHP
buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/php) and establishing a [Web
Server
buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/0006-web-servers.md).

We‚Äôve been working recently to streamline and codify the existing configuration
APIs. Buildpacks will continue to adopt environment variables as the primary
mechanism for their configuration, deprecating the use of `buildpack.yml` as we
reach a stable API across the existing set of buildpacks. Furthermore, we‚Äôll be
looking into streamlining and extending the log output and ‚Äúbill of materials‚Äù
metadata provided by all buildpacks.

We‚Äôve also recently started to provide a set of standardized common ‚Äúutility‚Äù
buildpacks across all language families. These buildpacks solve common use
cases such as using [Procfiles](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/procfile),
setting build/runtime [CA
Certificates](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ca-certificates), and
setting [environment
variables](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/environment-variables) on the
app image.

Beyond standardizing on our buildpack interfaces, the team will be considering
extensions to existing buildpacks to bring new runtimes and package manager
support. Examples of this type of extension include new Ruby runtimes like
`JRuby`, as well as functionality to generate code during the build process such
as using [`go generate`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go/pull/367).

## Expanding the Buildpack Ecosystem

Beyond solidifying the set of existing buildpacks, we want to continue to grow
the overall **buildpack ecosystem** to support new developers and use cases.

A huge part of growing the ecosystem involves building out new buildpacks.
We‚Äôre already starting to build out [better support for
Python](https://github.com/paketo-community/python/issues/226), and are looking
into how we can support new use cases like [function
platforms](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/pull/29). We‚Äôre looking to
see where we should next invest in new language ecosystems. Some ideas range
from Typescript and Swift to Nim and Pony.

An equally important part of growing the ecosystem involves engaging with the
community. We plan to focus on community outreach to inform you of what is
happening day-to-day, and also gather feedback about what we should be doing
next. We‚Äôll be focusing on improving documentation, reference materials, and
tutorials. And we‚Äôll be looking for ways to increase the discoverability of the
project and its buildpacks.

## Non-production Use Cases

We‚Äôd like to think that our buildpacks run great in production environments
(let us know if they don‚Äôt üòÑ). We want to go a bit further and start looking
into how we can improve the buildpack experience beyond production
environments.

We‚Äôll be looking into developing buildpacks and integrations that support
non-production use cases, and working with CNB project to propose any API
changes to accommodate these workflows. We hope to see buildpacks integrate
with IDEs and local-development frameworks, expose and enable in-container
debugging, and support running test suites while integrating with CI/CD
platforms.

## Summary

We have a lot lined up for 2021 and welcome new contributors! [Please join the
discussion](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/feedback/discussions/2) to
tell us what matters to you.

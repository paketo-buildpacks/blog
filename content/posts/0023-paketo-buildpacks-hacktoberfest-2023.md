## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a recurring (yearly) event that lasts the whole month of October and encourages participants to contribute to Open Source projects.

The contributions can be technical (code) but also about documentation -  the goal is to make a new population of developers familiar with Open Source.

[Digital Ocean and other companies](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/) organize this event each year and of course you win awards participating! 

You already have a Github account? that's all you need to participate! [Go ahead and register now](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/)!

## Contributing to Paketo Buildpacks

What about Paketo Buildpacks?

Turns out maintainers already try and tag some issues with labels such as `note:ideal-for-contribution` or `note:good-first-issue` or even `good first issue` or `note:good-first-issue`; so it was easy for us to add a new label to those issues and start participating in this event!

If you ever wondered how your favorite buildpacks work, even if you could already contribute before Hacktoberfest, now is definitely the best moment to start having a look and get rewarded by the program (Hacktoberfest will plant a tree for the first 50000 contributors!)

Not sure how to start? You can still reach the Paketo maintainers [on Slack](https://slack.paketo.io/); join in and ask away! We'll be happy to help!

## Ready, set, go!

Go and discover all the issues we tagged as **[hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apaketo-buildpacks++label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22++state%3Aopen+&type=issues&s=&o=desc)** and start working on your contributions!

## Bonus

Are you maintaining one or more Github repositories? 

Have a look at the [handy script we wrote and executed](https://gist.github.com/anthonydahanne/675a4623db2073c91a7e68ddf1dc5b4b) to add the label `hacktoberfest` to several of our existing issues.

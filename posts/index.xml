      <description>Node.js 24 entered active status in October 2025 according to the Node.js release schedule. We are excited to announce that it is now the default version for the Paketo Node.js buildpacks! This means that if no Node.js version is specified via the package.json file, .node-version file, .nvmrc file or through the BP_NODE_VERSION environment variable, the selected Node.js version will default to 24!&#xA;Although Node.js 24 has been available on Paketo Buildpacks since November 4th, 2025, via the node-engine buildpack, we had to ensure that all the Paketo Node.</description>

      <description>User Survey 2025 As long as I have been working on Paketo Buildpacks, it has been a challenge to understand how our users make use of the project. What buildpacks get used? What features are important? Where should we spend project time and resources? We just don&amp;rsquo;t know &amp;#x1f937;&amp;zwj;&amp;#x2642;&amp;#xfe0f;&#xA;This is because for your privacy, Paketo Buildpacks do not have telemetry in them nor do they capture any information about your usage patterns.</description>

      <description>We recently finished implementing the core builder RFC. This means quite a few changes across the Paketo Buildpacks organization, so we would like to walk you through the new structure (noble/UBI9) by comparing it with the old structure (jammy/UBI8) to highlight the differences.&#xA;Changes to Base images (former stacks) For Ubuntu Jammy, each repository publishes the build and the run image, as follows:&#xA;Jammy-full-stack&#xA;docker.io/paketobuildpacks/build-jammy-full docker.io/paketobuildpacks/run-jammy-full Jammy-base-stack&#xA;docker.io/paketobuildpacks/build-jammy-base docker.io/paketobuildpacks/run-jammy-base Jammy-tiny-stack</description>

It will be archived on May 9th, 2025.&#xA;Please see the RFC for rationale and details.&#xA;Action Items for You If you are using this buildpack, you have two choices on how to proceed.&#xA;You may migrate off it. The primary feature of this buildpack is that it includes the Microsoft OpenJDK JVM. You do not need this buildpack to use the Microsoft OpenJDK JVM though.</description>

      <description>The Paketo community has been working on UBI support over the last few years after agreeing on the direction in 0056-ubi-based-stacks.md.&#xA;Typically support for new components starts in the paketo-community organization and then is moved to the paketo-buildpacks organization once it matures.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s now time to move the builder-ubi-base and builder-ubi-buildpackless-base over to the paketo-buildpacks organization. We plan to do the move Wednesday April 16th.&#xA;We are publishing this blog post because this will impact users who have been using the builders to build their application with pack.</description>

      <description>Paketo Buildpacks: where are they used? While preparing for a talk about PaaS, I found out that CNBs (Cloud Native Buildpacks), in particular Paketo Buildpacks, are widely used across the industry!&#xA;Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s the Dockerfile as our main competition (with all its cons: maintainability, no SBOM generation, no third party agent nor a standard mechanism to include CA certs, etc.), but interestingly enough NixPacks (maintained by Railway but used in other PaaS too) are also gaining traction as our competitor.</description>

      <description>Urgent News We have important news regarding project infrastructure that requires your immediate attention. The Paketo Buildpacks GCP (Google Cloud Platform) project is scheduled to be shutdown in the near future, likely within the next two week.&#xA;I apologize that we cannot provide an exact date, as we do not have one ourselves. We were notified recently that our sponsor who was paying the bills for GCP will be halting that sponsorship.</description>

      <description>As an open-source project, Paketo Buildpacks depends on its maintainers to keep the project running day-to-day and to provide guidance to move the project forward. In a nutshell, maintainers keep the project running and produce all the software our users love.&#xA;Unfortunately, we have had a few maintainers move on from the project recently. This is a part of open-source software. People&amp;rsquo;s lives change, jobs change, interests change and they move on to other things.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time again, time to update the default Java version in Paketo Java buildpacks!&#xA;Through our community RFC process, the Paketo Java subteam adopted an official policy on updating the default version of the JVM, RFC #0014.&#xA;The policy states that &amp;ldquo;the default should be changed once the latest released LTS version of Java is at least one year old&amp;rdquo;. Java 21 was released in September of 2023, and it&amp;rsquo;s now October of 2024 which puts us over a year from the release.</description>

      <description>Paketo&amp;rsquo;s Bionic Builder Is Unsafe It&amp;rsquo;s a strange thing for the Paketo Project to call out its builder as being unsafe, but the key detail here is that it&amp;rsquo;s the Ubuntu Bionic Builder we&amp;rsquo;re saying is unsafe.&#xA;On May 31st, 2023, Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) went out of support for OSS customers (source). At the same time, the Paketo Project stopped supporting its Bionic Stacks and Builders based on Ubuntu 18.</description>

      <description>As of May 31, 2023, Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) is out of support for open-source customers.&#xA;As a result, Paketo will stop supporting Bionic in the project.

      <description>During the last few weeks, some enhancements were brought to buildpacks related to the Java ecosystem.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s discover what&amp;rsquo;s new!&#xA;TL;DR Checkout the samples repository for Java examples and the Paketo Buildpacks official documentation - those provide way more details about Paketo uses cases (native, certificates, network-less, etc.) than the different build plugins (Maven and Gradle) documentation.&#xA;And they&amp;rsquo;re always up-to-date! In the rare event they&amp;rsquo;re not, create an issue or Pull Request or reach us on Slack, and we will fix that!</description>

      <description>Time and tides wait for no one, nor does software. The Oracle and the OpenJDK project have been steadily releasing new versions of Java for years now, with new Java versions every six months and now long-term support releases every two years (with Java 21, it&amp;rsquo;s dropped to two years from three).&#xA;As of writing this post, the Java buildpack is currently using Java 11 as its default. This has been the same default version since the Paketo Java buildpack was released, but we&amp;rsquo;re falling behind and it&amp;rsquo;s time for a change.</description>

      <title>Buildpack Development: Selecting a Cloud-Native Buildpacks Library</title>
      <link>https://blog.paketo.io/posts/buildpack-dev-selecting-a-library/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.paketo.io/posts/buildpack-dev-selecting-a-library/</guid>
      <description>In the Paketo Buildpacks community, we’ve standardized around writing our buildpacks using the Go language. Go works great for buildpack development because it compiles down to a relatively compact static binary, so our buildpack images are small, and it runs very fast, so our buildpacks run fast. It also provides great support for testing and since we want to have rock solid buildpacks, testing is very important as well.&#xA;To write a buildpack in the Go language, it helps if you have a library that implements the Cloud-Native Buildpacks (CNB) specification.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new and exciting development in the Paketo Buildpacks project! The Paketo PHP Buildpack has been fully re-architected and is ready to make containerizing PHP applications simple and transparent. With the rearchitecture, the same base set of functionality is supported as in the original PHP buildpack, but the buildpacks have been modernized using the newest Paketo tooling and modularized to separate concerns into individual buildpacks.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s new? Breaking it down The rearchitecture has made it vastly easier for maintainers and contributors to add new functionality to the language family, by breaking down what used to be three larger buildpacks, into 10+ new buildpacks responsible for single parts of the build process.</description>

      <description>Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our 2021 Roadmap. We won’t be able to cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.&#xA;Solidifying Existing Buildpacks While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the progres we have made, including:&#xA;Moving to environment variables as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks Standardized handling of language-ecosystem environment variables such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and NODE_ENV Standardized versioning of buildpacks, stacks, and builders Standardized configuration options, including log levels and dependency mappings Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to: Configure additional CA Certificates Apply custom image labels Set runtime environment variables Contribute additional process types We also restructured the Python buildpack, improving modularity and composability.</description>

      <description>Photo by Jon Flobrant on Unsplash&#xA;Sharing what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned The Paketo Buildpacks Team has been developing our Cloud Native Buildpacks for the better part of 2 years now. In the process, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;ve made mistakes and interated toward solutions that are more flexible, easier to maintain, and provide better experiences for our users. In the process, we&amp;rsquo;ve developed a set of guidelines – a philosophy, maybe – for how we think about developing buildpacks.</description>

      <description>I’m pleased to announce that the Paketo Java Buildpack has been enhanced to make it even easier to analyze and debug your JVM based applications. A host of features have been added or integrated in the form of environment variable flags, and some features which previously required image rebuilds can now simply be toggled at runtime. This post will outline how to both configure the JVM itself and make use of the following features:</description>

      <description>Maybe you’ve heard that many companies today are transitioning to, or have already transitioned to, a container-based platform like Kubernetes. With this movement comes the need to containerize your applications, new and old. Buildpacks provide a seamless mechanism for doing that without Dockerfiles. Paketo Buildpacks is a community-driven project that provides Cloud Native Buildpacks implementations for the most popular languages.&#xA;Buildpacks provide great out-of-box support for many languages, but what if you need a buildpack that doesn’t exist yet?</description>

      <description>Paketo Buildpacks were a hot topic at the recently concluded Cloud Foundry Summit, the first virtual Summit run by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The Summit featured project updates, particularly in the Kubernetes space, including a talk on Paketo Buildpacks. Dan Thornton, an engineer contributing to the Paketo Buildpacks project, maintained that they are the ideal tool for transforming app source code into container images.&#xA;So, we wanted to share Dan’s talk here and dive into a Q&amp;amp;A of all of the questions we didn’t get to answer during this session.</description>

    In this post, I plan to share the framework the Paketo Buildpacks project will be using to approach the goal of building and sustaining an inclusive community of users, contributors and maintainers; and how it translates to a set of action items we will be executing during the remaining of 2022.
Currently, the project follows the Community Engagement guidelines and best practices outlined here as they represent a diverse set of initiatives designed to provide the community with tools and processes for improved collaboration.

    <h2><a href="/posts/webservers-rearchitecture/">Introducing the Paketo Web Servers Buildpack</a></h2>
    The Paketo team is pleased to introduce the Web Servers buildpack, available in the Paketo Full Builder as of version 0.2.74.
This buildpack allows you to serve static content using the popular NGINX or HTTPD web servers, with a variety of utilities for ease of use. Whether you have static files and a server configuration file that you want to package in an image, or you need to transform your dynamic content into static files and want the buildpack to generate the necessary server configuration file, the Web Servers buildpack has you covered.

    <h2><a href="/posts/php-rearchitecture/">Reintroducing the PHP Buildpack</a></h2>
    There&rsquo;s a new and exciting development in the Paketo Buildpacks project! The Paketo PHP Buildpack has been fully re-architected and is ready to make containerizing PHP applications simple and transparent. With the rearchitecture, the same base set of functionality is supported as in the original PHP buildpack, but the buildpacks have been modernized using the newest Paketo tooling and modularized to separate concerns into individual buildpacks.
What&rsquo;s new? Breaking it down The rearchitecture has made it vastly easier for maintainers and contributors to add new functionality to the language family, by breaking down what used to be three larger buildpacks, into 10+ new buildpacks responsible for single parts of the build process.

    Before we share the big plans we have for 2022, the Paketo Buildpacks Steering Committee would like to thank everyone that joined in the 2022 roadmap discussion, as well as everyone that’s provided feedback across all of the Paketo Buildpacks in 2021. The team is grateful for all of the feedback that we receive, as it helps to shape the project and ensure we’re building the tools that everyone wants to use.

    Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our 2021 Roadmap. We won’t be able to cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.
Solidifying Existing Buildpacks While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the progres we have made, including:
 Moving to environment variables as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks Standardized handling of language-ecosystem environment variables such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and NODE_ENV Standardized versioning of buildpacks, stacks, and builders Standardized configuration options, including log levels and dependency mappings Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to:  Configure additional CA Certificates Apply custom image labels Set runtime environment variables Contribute additional process types    We also restructured the Python buildpack, improving modularity and composability.

    Photo by Jon Flobrant on Unsplash
  Sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned The Paketo Buildpacks Team has been developing our Cloud Native Buildpacks for the better part of 2 years now. In the process, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve made mistakes and interated toward solutions that are more flexible, easier to maintain, and provide better experiences for our users. In the process, we&rsquo;ve developed a set of guidelines – a philosophy, maybe – for how we think about developing buildpacks.

    I’m pleased to announce that the Paketo Java Buildpack has been enhanced to make it even easier to analyze and debug your JVM based applications. A host of features have been added or integrated in the form of environment variable flags, and some features which previously required image rebuilds can now simply be toggled at runtime. This post will outline how to both configure the JVM itself and make use of the following features:

    <h2><a href="/posts/building-a-cloud-native-buildpack-isnt-as-hard-as-you-think/">Building a Cloud Native Buildpack Isn’t as Hard as You Think</a></h2>
    Maybe you’ve heard that many companies today are transitioning to, or have already transitioned to, a container-based platform like Kubernetes. With this movement comes the need to containerize your applications, new and old. Buildpacks provide a seamless mechanism for doing that without Dockerfiles. Paketo Buildpacks is a community-driven project that provides Cloud Native Buildpacks implementations for the most popular languages.
Buildpacks provide great out-of-box support for many languages, but what if you need a buildpack that doesn’t exist yet?

    On behalf of the Paketo contributors, I&rsquo;m pleased to unveil the new and improved .NET Core Buildpack! With the release of Paketo .NET Core Buildpack 0.1.0, you’ll enjoy a host of new features and improvements that will make containerizing your .NET apps a breeze. 🍃
With the new buildpack, you can:
 Build .NET 5 apps Build your app from source code, from a framework-dependent deployment (FDD), from a framework-dependent executable (FDE), or from a self-contained deployment Build Visual Basic apps Have source code removed from final app image.

 Establishing our project governance and RFC process Moving all project tooling to Github-based workflows Building out a foundational set of buildpacks for some of the most popular languages including Java, Node.

    Paketo Buildpacks were a hot topic at the recently concluded Cloud Foundry Summit, the first virtual Summit run by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The Summit featured project updates, particularly in the Kubernetes space, including a talk on Paketo Buildpacks. Dan Thornton, an engineer contributing to the Paketo Buildpacks project, maintained that they are the ideal tool for transforming app source code into container images.
So, we wanted to share Dan’s talk here and dive into a Q&amp;A of all of the questions we didn’t get to answer during this session.

    I’m excited to announce the launch of Paketo Buildpacks, a collection of Cloud Native Buildpacks for the most popular languages and frameworks. Paketo Buildpacks make it easy for you to build and patch containerized apps so that you can spend all your time on the thing that matters the most… developing great software.
First off… what are Paketo Buildpacks, and why would I use them?  Buildpacks provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps

    What has changed on how we ship the Builders and the base images We recently finished implementing the core builder RFC. This means quite a few changes across the Paketo Buildpacks organization, so we would like to walk you through the new structure (noble/UBI9) by comparing it with the old structure (jammy/UBI8) to highlight the differences.
Changes to Base images (former stacks) For Ubuntu Jammy, each repository publishes the build and the run image, as follows:

Please see the RFC for rationale and details.
Action Items for You If you are using this buildpack, you have two choices on how to proceed.
  You may migrate off it. The primary feature of this buildpack is that it includes the Microsoft OpenJDK JVM. You do not need this buildpack to use the Microsoft OpenJDK JVM though.

    Paketo Buildpacks: where are they used? While preparing for a talk about PaaS, I found out that CNBs (Cloud Native Buildpacks), in particular Paketo Buildpacks, are widely used across the industry!
Sure, there&rsquo;s the Dockerfile as our main competition (with all its cons: maintainability, no SBOM generation, no third party agent nor a standard mechanism to include CA certs, etc.), but interestingly enough NixPacks (maintained by Railway but used in other PaaS too) are also gaining traction as our competitor.

Through our community RFC process, the Paketo Java subteam adopted an official policy on updating the default version of the JVM, RFC #0014.
The policy states that &ldquo;the default should be changed once the latest released LTS version of Java is at least one year old&rdquo;. Java 21 was released in September of 2023, and it&rsquo;s now October of 2024 which puts us over a year from the release.

    In the Paketo Buildpacks community, we’ve standardized around writing our buildpacks using the Go language. Go works great for buildpack development because it compiles down to a relatively compact static binary, so our buildpack images are small, and it runs very fast, so our buildpacks run fast. It also provides great support for testing and since we want to have rock solid buildpacks, testing is very important as well.
To write a buildpack in the Go language, it helps if you have a library that implements the Cloud-Native Buildpacks (CNB) specification.

    There&rsquo;s a new and exciting development in the Paketo Buildpacks project! The Paketo PHP Buildpack has been fully re-architected and is ready to make containerizing PHP applications simple and transparent. With the rearchitecture, the same base set of functionality is supported as in the original PHP buildpack, but the buildpacks have been modernized using the newest Paketo tooling and modularized to separate concerns into individual buildpacks.
What&rsquo;s new? Breaking it down The rearchitecture has made it vastly easier for maintainers and contributors to add new functionality to the language family, by breaking down what used to be three larger buildpacks, into 10+ new buildpacks responsible for single parts of the build process.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2022-roadmap/">Paketo Buildpacks 2022 - Full speed ahead</a></h2>
    Before we share the big plans we have for 2022, the Paketo Buildpacks Steering Committee would like to thank everyone that joined in the 2022 roadmap discussion, as well as everyone that’s provided feedback across all of the Paketo Buildpacks in 2021. The team is grateful for all of the feedback that we receive, as it helps to shape the project and ensure we’re building the tools that everyone wants to use.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2021-recap/">Paketo Buildpacks 2021 - A Year in Review</a></h2>
    Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our 2021 Roadmap. We won’t be able to cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.
Solidifying Existing Buildpacks While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the progres we have made, including:
 Moving to environment variables as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks Standardized handling of language-ecosystem environment variables such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and NODE_ENV Standardized versioning of buildpacks, stacks, and builders Standardized configuration options, including log levels and dependency mappings Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to:  Configure additional CA Certificates Apply custom image labels Set runtime environment variables Contribute additional process types    We also restructured the Python buildpack, improving modularity and composability.

    Photo by Jon Flobrant on Unsplash
  Sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned The Paketo Buildpacks Team has been developing our Cloud Native Buildpacks for the better part of 2 years now. In the process, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve made mistakes and interated toward solutions that are more flexible, easier to maintain, and provide better experiences for our users. In the process, we&rsquo;ve developed a set of guidelines – a philosophy, maybe – for how we think about developing buildpacks.

    <h2><a href="/posts/java-rearchitecture/">Java Buildpack Support and Debug Enhancements</a></h2>
    I’m pleased to announce that the Paketo Java Buildpack has been enhanced to make it even easier to analyze and debug your JVM based applications. A host of features have been added or integrated in the form of environment variable flags, and some features which previously required image rebuilds can now simply be toggled at runtime. This post will outline how to both configure the JVM itself and make use of the following features:

    <h2><a href="/posts/building-a-cloud-native-buildpack-isnt-as-hard-as-you-think/">Building a Cloud Native Buildpack Isn’t as Hard as You Think</a></h2>
    Maybe you’ve heard that many companies today are transitioning to, or have already transitioned to, a container-based platform like Kubernetes. With this movement comes the need to containerize your applications, new and old. Buildpacks provide a seamless mechanism for doing that without Dockerfiles. Paketo Buildpacks is a community-driven project that provides Cloud Native Buildpacks implementations for the most popular languages.
Buildpacks provide great out-of-box support for many languages, but what if you need a buildpack that doesn’t exist yet?

    Paketo Buildpacks were a hot topic at the recently concluded Cloud Foundry Summit, the first virtual Summit run by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The Summit featured project updates, particularly in the Kubernetes space, including a talk on Paketo Buildpacks. Dan Thornton, an engineer contributing to the Paketo Buildpacks project, maintained that they are the ideal tool for transforming app source code into container images.
So, we wanted to share Dan’s talk here and dive into a Q&amp;A of all of the questions we didn’t get to answer during this session.

    I’m excited to announce the launch of Paketo Buildpacks, a collection of Cloud Native Buildpacks for the most popular languages and frameworks. Paketo Buildpacks make it easy for you to build and patch containerized apps so that you can spend all your time on the thing that matters the most… developing great software.
First off… what are Paketo Buildpacks, and why would I use them?  Buildpacks provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps

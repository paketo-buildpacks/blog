    <h2><a href="/posts/webservers-rearchitecture/">Introducing the Paketo Web Servers Buildpack</a></h2>
    The Paketo team is pleased to introduce the Web Servers buildpack, available in the Paketo Full Builder as of version 0.2.74.
This buildpack allows you to serve static content using the popular NGINX or HTTPD web servers, with a variety of utilities for ease of use. Whether you have static files and a server configuration file that you want to package in an image, or you need to transform your dynamic content into static files and want the buildpack to generate the necessary server configuration file, the Web Servers buildpack has you covered.

    <h2><a href="/posts/php-rearchitecture/">Reintroducing the PHP Buildpack</a></h2>
    There&rsquo;s a new and exciting development in the Paketo Buildpacks project! The Paketo PHP Buildpack has been fully re-architected and is ready to make containerizing PHP applications simple and transparent. With the rearchitecture, the same base set of functionality is supported as in the original PHP buildpack, but the buildpacks have been modernized using the newest Paketo tooling and modularized to separate concerns into individual buildpacks.
What&rsquo;s new? Breaking it down The rearchitecture has made it vastly easier for maintainers and contributors to add new functionality to the language family, by breaking down what used to be three larger buildpacks, into 10+ new buildpacks responsible for single parts of the build process.

    Before we share the big plans we have for 2022, the Paketo Buildpacks Steering Committee would like to thank everyone that joined in the 2022 roadmap discussion, as well as everyone that’s provided feedback across all of the Paketo Buildpacks in 2021. The team is grateful for all of the feedback that we receive, as it helps to shape the project and ensure we’re building the tools that everyone wants to use.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2021-recap/">Paketo Buildpacks 2021 - A Year in Review</a></h2>
    Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our 2021 Roadmap. We won’t be able to cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.
Solidifying Existing Buildpacks While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the progres we have made, including:
 Moving to environment variables as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks Standardized handling of language-ecosystem environment variables such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and NODE_ENV Standardized versioning of buildpacks, stacks, and builders Standardized configuration options, including log levels and dependency mappings Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to:  Configure additional CA Certificates Apply custom image labels Set runtime environment variables Contribute additional process types    We also restructured the Python buildpack, improving modularity and composability.

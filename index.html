    <h2><a href="/posts/2021-recap/">Paketo Buildpacks 2021 - A Year in Review</a></h2>
    Thanks so much to the Paketo community for all your hard work over the last year! The project made significant progress on the themes identified in our 2021 Roadmap. We won’t be able to cover everything in this blog post, but here are some highlights.
Solidifying Existing Buildpacks While the work of standardizing our buildpacks continues, we are proud of the progres we have made, including:
 Moving to environment variables as the primary mode of configuration for all buildpacks Standardized handling of language-ecosystem environment variables such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and NODE_ENV Standardized versioning of buildpacks, stacks, and builders Standardized configuration options, including log levels and dependency mappings Inclusion of utility buildpacks in all language families, allowing users to:  Configure additional CA Certificates Apply custom image labels Set runtime environment variables Contribute additional process types    We also restructured the Python buildpack, improving modularity and composability.

    Before we share the big plans we have for 2022, the Paketo Buildpacks Steering Committee would like to thank everyone that joined in the 2022 roadmap discussion, as well as everyone that’s provided feedback across all of the Paketo Buildpacks in 2021. The team is grateful for all of the feedback that we receive, as it helps to shape the project and ensure we’re building the tools that everyone wants to use.

    <h2><a href="/posts/introducing-liberty-buildpack/">Introducing the Liberty buildpack</a></h2>
    Liberty is finally available in Paketo and included in the java buildpack! Liberty is an open application framework designed for the cloud. It’s small, lightweight, and designed with modern cloud-native application development in mind.
With the Liberty buildpack, you can:
 Build Java apps from source or a pre-configured on-prem Liberty Install Liberty and user custom features Install Liberty interim fixes Create UBI-based OCI images  What do you need?  Your application source or a pre-configured on-prem Liberty Docker pack  Let&rsquo;s get started!

    <h2><a href="/posts/buildpack-philosophy-part-1/">A Philosophy for Developing Paketo Buildpacks, Part 1</a></h2>
    Photo by Jon Flobrant on Unsplash
  Sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned The Paketo Buildpacks Team has been developing our Cloud Native Buildpacks for the better part of 2 years now. In the process, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve made mistakes and interated toward solutions that are more flexible, easier to maintain, and provide better experiences for our users. In the process, we&rsquo;ve developed a set of guidelines – a philosophy, maybe – for how we think about developing buildpacks.

    <h2><a href="/posts/java-rearchitecture/">Java Buildpack Support and Debug Enhancements</a></h2>
    I’m pleased to announce that the Paketo Java Buildpack has been enhanced to make it even easier to analyze and debug your JVM based applications. A host of features have been added or integrated in the form of environment variable flags, and some features which previously required image rebuilds can now simply be toggled at runtime. This post will outline how to both configure the JVM itself and make use of the following features:
